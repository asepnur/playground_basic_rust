// rules of ownership
// 1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
// 2. There can only be one owner at a time.
// 3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.


// to enable copy, added derive Copy and Clone to your struct
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]

    age: i32,

    // the ownership of z has assigned to w
    // this code will produce error
    // println!("w: {}, z: {}", w, z);
